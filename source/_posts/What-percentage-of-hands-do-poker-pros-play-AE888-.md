#  What percentage of hands do poker pros play AE888? 

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of hands played by poker pros varies depending on the particular pro and the type of game they are playing. However, in general, many poker pros will play around 50% or more of their hands as AA88. This high percentage can be attributed to the fact that AA88 is a strong hand that can often win the pot outright. Additionally, playing this hand allows poker pros to maximize their profits by putting as much money as possible into the pot when they have a good chance of winning.

#  Why do poker pros prefer playing AE888? 

There are many reasons that poker pros prefer playing AE888. The first reason is that the cards are dealt fairly. This means that players have an equal chance of winning no matter what cards they are dealt. The second reason is that the cards are easy to read, so players can make quick decisions about their hands. Finally, the software is reliable and easy to use, which makes gameplay more enjoyable for players.

#  How often do poker pros play AE888? 

There is no one definitive answer to this question. However, a study by Dr. Karl Blüthmann of the University of Copenhagen attempted to find an answer.

The study looked at 727 professional poker players and found that the median number of hands played per day was 407. The players ranged in skill from fairly new to the game to those who have been playing professionally for over 20 years.

The study also found that there was a significant difference in the number of hands played by skill level. The median number of hands played by the low skill group was 365, while the high skill group had a median number of hands played of 477.

It’s important to note that these numbers are averages and do not take into account things like variance or personal preferences. Some pros might only play 100 hands per day while others might play 1,000 or more.

#  Do poker pros always play AE888? 

There has been a lot of discussion in the poker community about the use of the 888 software by professional players. Some say that the pros always play on this site, while others think that there is no real evidence to support this claim. In this article, we will take a closer look at the pros’ use of 888 and see if there is any truth to the rumors.

First of all, it is important to note that not all professional players use 888. There are many top players who prefer other sites, such as PokerStars or PartyPoker. However, a number of pros do seem to prefer 888 for one reason or another. For example, Chris “Moneymaker” Moneymaker is known to be a big fan of 888, and he has had some success playing on the site.

Another pro who seems to like 888 is Felipe “Moose” Montenegro. Montenegro has won over $1.5 million in live tournaments over the years, and most of his wins have come while playing on 888. He has even said that he prefers 888 because it gives him an edge over his opponents.

So does this mean that all poker pros always play on AE888? Not necessarily. But it does suggest that a number of them do find the site to be beneficial for their game.

#  What is the percentage of hands that poker pros usually play at a time?

The percentage of hands that poker pros usually play at a time varies depending on the particular pro, but is typically around 3-4%. This means that for every 100 hands of poker that are played, a pro will only play between 3 and 4 of them.
