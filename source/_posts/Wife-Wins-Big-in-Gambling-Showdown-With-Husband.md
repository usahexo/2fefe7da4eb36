#  Wife Wins Big in Gambling Showdown With Husband

In a recent turn of events, a wife has bested her husband in a high-stakes gambling match, causing the husband to lose a significant sum of money.

The wife, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that she has been gambling for years and is very good at it. She also says that she has no sympathy for her husband, who is "an absolute idiot when it comes to gambling".

The husband, who was apparently unaware of his wife's skills until now, is said to be "devastated" by the loss. He is now reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy.

#  Wife Forces Husband to Pay Back All Gambling Losses

Mrs. Sarah May forced her husband to pay back all of his gambling losses after he had lost their family's life savings. The husband, John, had unsuccessfully tried to hide his gambling addiction from his wife for months before she finally caught on and found out where all the money had been disappearing to.

"I'm sorry, honey," John said tearfully as he handed over the last of his poker winnings to Mrs. May. "I'll never gamble again."

"You damn well better not," Mrs. May said sternly. "You've put us in a lot of debt and I don't want to see that happen again. Now go get a job and start paying us back."

John did as he was told and got a job at a local grocery store. He started making payments on the family's debt and managed to pay it all off within a year. He also made sure to never gamble again, much to his wife's relief.

#  Wife Forces Husband to Quit Gambling for Good

__For years, John had been a gambling addict. He would spend all his spare time and money at the casino, trying to make back what he lost. His wife, Diana, had begged him to quit, but he just wouldn't listen. __

__Earlier this year, however, Diana finally got fed up. She threatened to leave him if he didn't get his gambling addiction under control. John knew she was serious, so he agreed to her terms. He would quit gambling for good and never speak of it again. __

__It's now been six months since John gave up gambling and he's never felt better. He has more time for his wife and kids and doesn't have to worry about losing all his money. Diana is very happy with the results and is glad she was finally able to get her husband to quit gambling for good.

#  Wife Finally Gets Her Revenge on Gambler Husband

My wife is an amazing woman. She's always been there for me, through thick and thin, good times and bad. So when I started gambling and losing money left and right, she was the one who stuck by me.

But even the most patient person has a breaking point, and my wife finally reached hers. After I'd gambled away our entire savings, she came up with a plan to get her revenge on me. And it was genius.

She started going out with other men. Not just any other men, but wealthy men. Men with money to burn. And she would spend hours on the phone with me, telling me how much fun she was having, how much they were spending on her, and how much she loved them.

It drove me crazy! I could practically feel their hands all over her, and it made me insanely jealous. I wanted her back more than anything, but I also knew that if I didn't stop gambling she would leave me for good.

So I cleaned up my act. I stopped going to the casino, stopped borrowing money from friends, and started paying back what I owed. It was hard work, but it was worth it to have my wife back by my side. And now we're happier than ever.
