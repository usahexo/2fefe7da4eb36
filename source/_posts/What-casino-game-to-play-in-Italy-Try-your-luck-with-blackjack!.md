#  Play craps and try to roll a seven in beautiful Italy!

 Craps is one of the most popular casino games and is known for its high volatility. In this article, we take a look at how to play craps and strategies you can use to increase your chances of winning.

To begin with, the aim of craps is simple – to roll a seven or eleven with two dice. If you roll anything else, you lose. You can bet on the outcome of each throw, and the odds change depending on what you bet on. You can also make multiple bets on different outcomes simultaneously.

One of the simplest wagers in craps is betting on the “pass line”. This means that you are betting that the next throw will be a seven or eleven. If it is, you win; if it’s not, you lose. The bet pays even money (1:1), so if you bet $10 and win, you get paid $10 back plus your original stake of $10, for a total profit of $20.

There are a few other things worth knowing about playing craps before we move on to some more advanced strategies. First, there is a “come out” roll in which the shooter (the person throwing the dice) establishes a point number. If they roll a seven or an eleven on the come out roll, they immediately win and the round ends. If they roll any other number, that becomes the point number and they must continue throwing until either they roll that number again or it becomes a seven, at which point they lose and the round ends.

If you want to place another bet after the come out roll, this is called a “odds bet”. To make an odds bet, simply place your chips behind the pass line (or any other bet) and say “odds on”. You are then betting that the point number will be rolled before a seven is thrown. The payout for this bet depends on the point number – for example, if the point number is four or ten then your odds payout would be 2:1 (meaning you would get paid $2 for every $1 you stake).

Now that we know how to play craps and some of the basics about wagers available at our disposal lets take a look at some more advanced strategy tips! 

When making any Pass Line Bet ALWAYS make an ODDS BET alongside it! NEVER FOLD YOUR ODDS BET!!!

  By doing this you are almost GUARANTEED TO WIN in the long run as your percentage chance of winning both bets combined together is significantly higher than when only making one or neither type of bet!!! 

  Another thing worth noting when playing craps is that dealers LOVE players who make lots of small bets (this includes both PASS LINE AND ODDS BETS). So by making many small bets instead of just 1 or 2 big ones, not only are you increasing your chances to win but also ensuring that YOU are keeping the dealer busy instead of someone else at the table!

#  Try your hand at poker in an Italian casino – who knows, you might be the next Antonio Esfandiari!

If you’ve always wanted to try your hand at poker, and you happen to be in Italy, what could be better than giving a casino a go? There are plenty of casinos around the country, each with their own style and gaming options. You could try your luck at one of the big resorts like Casino di Campione or Casino della Valle d’Aosta, or check out one of the smaller venues for a more intimate experience.

No matter where you choose to play, you’ll need to know the basics of poker before you sit down at the table. The good news is that it’s not too difficult to learn the rules – and even if you don’t speak Italian, most casinos will have staff who can help you get started. Here are just a few of the things you need to know:

How to Play Poker

Poker is a fun and social game that can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. The objective is simple – players use their cards to form the best possible five-card hand, using any combination of community cards and their own two hole cards. The player with the best hand at the end of the round wins the pot.

There are various types of poker, but Texas Hold ‘Em is probably the most popular variant. In this game, each player is dealt two hole cards, and five community cards are placed face-up on the table. Players must use two of their hole cards together with three community cards to make their best hand.

When it’s your turn, you can either bet or fold; betting involves placing chips into the pot in order to remain in the game. If another player has already bet, you may be able to raise – in other words, put in more chips than they did in order to increase the size of the pot. When it comes time for showdown, players reveal their hands and compare them against each other. The player with the best hand wins all of the chips in the pot!

Casino Etiquette

Of course, as with any game, there are some basic etiquette rules that you should follow when playing poker in a casino environment. Firstly, always make sure that you have enough money to cover your bets. If you run out of cash during a hand, you can either fold or ask for a loan from another player (although this is not recommended).

Secondly, remember that it’s considered bad manners to boast about your hand or rub your winnings in other players’ faces. And finally, always show respect for your fellow players – after all, poker is meant to be fun!
