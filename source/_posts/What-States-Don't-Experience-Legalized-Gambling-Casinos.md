#  What States Haven't Gone Legal With Gambling Casinos?

Since the early 1990s, when casinos were legalized in New Jersey, thereâ€™s been a gradual nationwide push toward legalizing gambling casinos in every state. However, there are still a few holdouts where gambling is either entirely illegal or not allowed in casinos.

Gambling is banned in all forms in Utah and Hawaii. In Alabama, lawful gambling is limited to bingo and the Alabama lottery. Tribal gaming is allowed in Oklahoma, but only on Native American reservations.

Rhode Island was the most recent state to change its laws and legalize gambling casinos in January 2018. This leaves Connecticut as the last remaining East Coast state without legalized gambling casinos. In contrast, Nevada has been a casino haven since its legalization of gambling in 1931.

West Virginia was the first to jump on the bandwagon, legalizing commercial casinos in 1992. States like California and Texas followed soon after with their own industrial-scale casino operations. Pennsylvania became a big player in 2006 when it legalized table games and slot machines in addition to its existing horse racing industry.

Atlantic City was once seen as the epicenter of East Coast gambling, but its casino market has been struggling lately due to competition from surrounding states. This has led some casino proponents to argue for expanded legalization of gambling beyond current limits in order to revive the industry.

#  Why don't these states have legalized gambling casinos?
