#  How will the judging process work?

The judging process for the World Cup will be a little different than what we are used to. In the group stages, all of the matches will be worth three points. The top two teams from each group will then move on to the Round of 16. The Round of 16 matches will be single elimination, with the winners moving on to the Quarterfinals. The Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals will all be two-legged ties, with the winners moving onto the next round. If a match is drawn after both legs have been played, away goals will be used to determine a winner (so if Team A has scored two goals away from home but Team B has only scored one goal at home, Team A would win).

This change was made to make sure that every match in the World Cup is important. With all of the teams in a group playing each other twice, it can be easy for teams to pick up points and move on. This also means that there is more chance for underdog teams to make it deep into the tournament.

#  What are the prize categories?

There are many different prize categories that you can enter into when it comes to contests. However, some of the most popular ones include:

-Best Song

-Best Actor

-Best Actress

-Best Film

-Best Director


#  How will the contestants be selected?

The selection of contestants for the show will be done through a rigorous process that will include an application and interview process.

Firstly, potential contestants will need to submit an online application. This application will ask for basic information such as name, age, occupation and contact details. It will also ask questions about the contestant’s personal life and why they would like to take part in the show.

Once the applications have been received, a shortlist of candidates will be created. These candidates will then be invited to attend an interview in person. The interviews will be conducted by the show’s producers and will assess the candidates’ suitability for the show. The final selection of contestants will be made based on these interviews.

#  What kind of music is allowed?

There is no definitive answer to this question as people enjoy different types of music. However, there are some general guidelines that can be followed.

Generally, light and positive music is recommended for use during massage therapy sessions. This could include classical music, jazz, or new-age music. Avoid using songs with heavy basslines or lyrics as they can be distracting and may negatively affect the session.

If you are not sure what type of music is best for your client, it may be helpful to ask them directly. Some people prefer silence or nature sounds during their massage, while others enjoy light background music.

#  What is the deadline for submissions?

The deadline for submissions is typically in the early fall, but be sure to check the website of the specific journal you are interested in. 

# What are the main types of submissions?

There are three different types of submissions: 

1. Research papers- these papers present original empirical or theoretical work conducted by the author(s). 
2. Case studies- these papers present an in-depth examination of a particular phenomenon or practice. 
3. Position papers- these papers present the author's stance on a particular issue/debate.
