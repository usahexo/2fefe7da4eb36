In a stunning turn of events, Wemco the Aged Armed Bandit Slot Machine Loan Company is shutting down!

The company has been in business for over 60 years, and has been a fixture in the Las Vegas casino scene. But declining profits have forced its hand.

Slot machine loan companies have been in decline for years, as casinos have moved towards tighter security measures that make it more difficult for players to borrow money.

Wemco is the latest casualty in a long line of companies to call it quits.

#  Wemco the Aged Armed Bandit Slot Machine Loan Company is Facing Lawsuit!

In a recent turn of events, Wemco the Aged Armed Bandit Slot Machine Loan Company is now facing a lawsuit. The loan company is being sued by one of its former customers for alleged usury.

The customer, who is remaining anonymous, claims that Wemco charged them an annual interest rate of more than 1000 percent on a $500 loan. This is well above the legal limit in most states.

In response to the lawsuit, Wemco has issued a statement denying all allegations of wrongdoing. The company insists that it has always followed state and federal laws regarding interest rates.

It remains to be seen how this case will play out in court. If the customer is successful, Wemco could be forced to pay back millions of dollars in interest payments. This would be a major blow to the company, which is already struggling financially.

#  Wemco the Aged Armed Bandit Slot Machine Loan Company is Making a Comeback!

Slot machines have been around in one form or another since the late 1800s. Charles Fey is credited with inventing the first coin-operated slot machine in San Francisco in 1894. Slot machines were illegal in many parts of the country until the 1930s, when gambling was legalized in Las Vegas.

Wemco, short for Wiesner Electric Manufacturing Company, was founded in 1932 by Herman Wiesner and soon became a leading manufacturer of slot machines. Wemco was one of the first companies to offer loans to casinos to buy its machines. The company prospered during the 1950s and 1960s, but began to decline in the 1970s as gambling laws changed and competition from foreign manufacturers increased.

In 1990, Wemco filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. But a new company has recently purchased the trademark and plans to start producing slot machines again. Wemco fans are excited about the prospect of gaming with "the old-fashioned feel of a true classic."

## What do you need to get started?

To get started, you'll need a few key items:

1. A Wemco slot machine (or any other type of slot machine, for that matter)
2. A location to place your machine(s)
3. Enough money to cover the cost of your machines and start-up costs
4. Some business knowledge and acumen
5. The drive and determination to make your business a success!

That's it! With those five items, you're ready to open your own Wemco slot machine loan company. Let's take a closer look at each of those requirements.

## Location, Location, Location!

The first thing you'll need is a suitable location for your business. This could be anything from a storefront in a busy shopping district to a location in a casino or amusement park. You'll need to weigh the pros and cons of each location and decide which is best for your business model. In some cases, you may even want to consider starting an online lending company. That decision is up to you, but it's something you should consider if you want to reach more potential borrowers.


 ## Get Your Machines in Place!

The next step is to get your machines in place so borrowers can start making loans using them! This can be done in a number of ways, depending on where you decide to set up shop. If you have a storefront, you can place the machines right inside the store. If you're in a casino or amusement park, you may want to put them on-site for easier access by borrowers. You'll also need to make sure there's enough room for people to stand around the machines and play them. Too much crowding can lead to problems, so plan accordingly!

 ## Funding Your Business Venture 
Now that you have everything in place, it's time to fund your business venture! This can be done in a variety of ways, but most businesses will need some form of startup capital. You may want to consider approaching investors or taking out a loan from a bank or lending institution. Make sure you have everything well planned out before seeking funding; nothing will turn potential investors off more than seeing that your business isn't well thought out or lacks direction.

 ## Knowledge is Power  One of the most important things you'll need as an entrepreneur is knowledge about what it takes to run a successful business . This includes understanding things like marketing, accounting, and even human resources management . It's also important to know what NOT do do when running your own company; avoid common mistakes by reading up on entrepreneurial advice and anecdotes from others who have been successful (and unsuccessful ) in their own ventures .

 ## The Drive To Succeed  Last but not least , you'll need the drive and determination to make your business venture succeed . No one ever became successful without putting in hard work and dedication , so be prepared for some long hours and plenty of stress as you work towards building your empire . With perseverance , skill , and luck , anything is possible !
